# flask_sql_pop
This is an incomplete personal use extension I have been working on for one of my flask app projects. It works with the "app factory" design, and is intended to populate a specific SQL table (empty) upon app initialization. The table it is currently populating is called dictionary, and has two columns: word, definition.  The extension uses an existing JSON file type object to extract the data with which to populate the table. It seems to have more success with a JSON list than a JSON object, and behaves problematically once more than 50 or so items are being populated.
